# These are the two main functions that are defined as part of Assignment 2 of R
# Programming Course on Coursera. This assignment is about lexical scoping.
# From all that I have read on the forum, it seems that this is more like an 
# exercise and does not have practial usage at least in the form as is.

# For this exercise I am following the methodology used in the example given as
# part of the assignment instructions.

# The first function "makeCacheMatrix()" is going to work as a replacement for
# the general matrix class. Instead of a matrix, it creates a list of 4
# functions. These 4 functions are named:
# 1. set
# 2. get
# 3. set.inverse
# 4. get.inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
